# Travel Agency Database System

## Overview

This repository contains the **Travel Agency Database System**, a project designed to manage and streamline the operations of a travel agency. The system focuses on customer bookings, package deals, payments, travel arrangements, destinations, hotels, and activities. The repository includes an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**, **Technical Documentation**, a **Presentation**, and a **Visual Example** that collectively demonstrate the design, implementation, and workflow of the database system.

This project is a practical example of **Database Systems** in action, showcasing skills in **database modelling**, **SQL**, **relational database design**, and **cloud-based database management**. It also highlights the use of **Microsoft Azure** for securing and managing the database.
